# MultiKamek
Allows to easily switch between multiple kamek instances

To use with https://github.com/Treeki/NewerSMBW/tree/no-translations/Kamek

# Usage
Get the latest build in https://github.com/RedStoneMatt/MultiKamek/releases or build the code by yourself.

Fill the textboxes and checkboxes and click the "Compile" button

You can save your actual settings by entering a name in the Save textbox, and then by clicking Save.

To load a previous project, enter the name you used to save it in the Load textbox, and then click Load.

It can be useful if you have multiple NewerSMBW Projects and don't want to search for your compiling bat file in your umpteenth project folder.

# Why did I made that ?
Because I wanted to, so people saying "duh this is useless" then shut up and don't use it if you don't want of it.

# There's some weird things, like "BetterKamek", what's that ?
That's a WIP project by LoryTheGamer, for now that checkbox useless but in the future, who knows...
